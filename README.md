VisualPDE (<a href="https://visualpde.com">visualpde.com</a>) provides programmable, interactive, web-based simulations.

The program for each simulation is included in the link, so the following show some images and animations along with the links for simulations I have made for atmospheric dynamics classes. These simulations are based on examples from the website and include the barotropic vorticity equation, the shallow water equations, and 2D convection.

with a ring of vorticity as an initial condition:
