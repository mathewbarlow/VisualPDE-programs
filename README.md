<b>VisualPDE</b> (<a href="https://visualpde.com">visualpde.com</a>) provides programmable, interactive, web-based simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs).

The program for each simulation is included in the link, so the following show some animations along with the corresponding links for simulations I have made for atmospheric dynamics classes. These simulations are mostly based on examples from the website and include the barotropic vorticity equation, the shallow water equations, and 2D convection.
